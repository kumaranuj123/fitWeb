<strong><-------Beginner gym workout for strength-------></strong>
The rep range for strength training is 4 – 6 reps and the idea behind this plan is to
 exert more energy for less reps (which will mean lifting heavier). If it’s your first time 
 lifting for strength, don’t go too heavy – use a manageable weight for the first few weeks and then increase
  the load as the weeks go on. Once you think you could lift for 8-10 reps on the same weight, it’s time to 
  increase the weight. Read this guide to help you get started.

<strong><--------Beginner gym workout for fat loss----------></strong>
This workout is designed to raise your heart rate and get you sweating.
 The purpose behind this is to push your cardiovascular fitness - when your 
 heart rate is higher you burn more calories. It also has the added benefit of burning 
 extra calories after you've finished the workout, as your body is still working hard to recover
  back to its normal state of function. So you're essentially burning more while resting just 
  for training your heart a bit harder during your workout. Read this guide to help you get started.

  cardiovascular fitness and make your heart stronger and efficient. It’s a good way to prep yourself
   for a HIIT class from a breathing point of view. Read this guide to help you get started.
